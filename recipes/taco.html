        <h2>Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style</h2>
        <p>made with braised beef that's slow-cooked in a fragrant 3-chile sauce with a delicious spice mix.</p><p> Crispy tacos, and tender, mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican cheese in this impressive meal.</p><p>This recipe takes a little time but it's so worth it!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Dried chile peppers:</h4>The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.</li>
            <li><h4>Beef: </h4>Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
            <li><h4>Seasonings: </h4>You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>
            <li><h4>Olive oil: </h4>Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>
            <li><h4>Tomatoes: </h4>Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.</li>
            <li><h4>Vinegar: </h4>Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.</li>
            <li><h4>Tortillas: </h4>Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.</li>
            <li><h4>Onion and Cilantro: </h4>Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and texture.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.</li>
            <li>Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.</li>
            <li>Blend the soaked chili peppers with the reserved chile water, tomatoes, vinegar, and seasonings.</li>
            <li>Strain the sauce and pour over the meat. Cover the Dutch oven and cook until the meat begins to fall apart, basting often. Allow the meat to rest, then shred.</li>
            <li>Warm the tortillas on the griddle. Fill each tortilla with meat, onions, and cilantro.</li>
